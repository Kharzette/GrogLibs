Lighthelper should find the best lighting for mobile meshes:
	Best light details for a shadow of the mesh
	Best light to do trilight illumination
	Best fill for the trilight fill lights

When switching from a previous best light to a new best light, a period of interpolation should
occur.

From point light to point light:
	interpolate the positions and colors, attenuating color and fill

From point light to sun light:
	Make the point light position into a direction
	Interpolate the directions
	Sunlights are not attenuated, so during interpolation, lerp attenuation factor
	Attenuate color and fill during interpolation via lerped attenuation factor

From sun light to sun light:
	Interpolate direction and colors

from sun light to point light:
	Convert the sun direction into a position, probably quite distant
	Interpolate positions
	Sunlights are not attenuated, so during interpolation, lerp attenuation factor from 1
	Attenuate color and fill during interpolation

Note that intensity cannot be used for attenuation.  It is used as a distance to fade out shadows.
For point lights this directly corresponds to the point light's strength.  For suns this is just a
number that prevents the shadow from showing through too much geometry in very non-convex levels.

It would be cool to be able to set this intensity value per light or maybe per area to get the
value just right so there's no shadow bleed thru.
