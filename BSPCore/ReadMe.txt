This is a port of the Genesis 3D utility code written by the fine folks at Eclipse Entertainment.

The Genesis code base belongs to David Stafford, a great chap who gave me permission to port this to C#.

It's old and crusty and most people have moved on from BSP stuff but I love this era of games.

Parts of my code are also grabbed from Quake 2, which I believe is GPL.

Genesis had taken a lot of ideas from Quake 2 anyway (and you can see the similarity if you look at
the code bases side by side), so some of this probably belongs to id software / John Carmack.

I've also added quite a bit of stuff, and likely broken quite a lot as well.  I'm fairly certain there
are some nasty bugs in the vis code, but hopefully it will hold up for Ludum Dare.

Most of the Genesis code was written by a brilliant fellow by the name of John Pollard, who is one of
the best coders I've ever worked with.  Also on the project were my mentors Jim Mischel and Eli Boling,
as well as Mike Sandige, and of course David Stafford.

So in other words, I have no idea if this stuff is legal to use for this and that situation, but it
should be fine for Ludum Dare.
